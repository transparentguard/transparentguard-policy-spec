## [Unreleased] — Phase 10: Performance, Security Posture, and Provider Adapters

### Added

**Fail-open / fail-closed (`fail_mode`) — Section 5.1 & Section 3a**
- `fail_mode: "open" | "closed"` field on `TPSEnvironment` and `TPSPolicy`.
- Controls runtime behaviour when the TG engine itself errors (not a policy violation).
- `"closed"` (default): block request on engine error — safest for compliance environments.
- `"open"`: pass request through with audit error event — better uptime for dev/staging.
- Environment-level `fail_mode` overrides policy-level `fail_mode`.
- JSON schema `tps-v1.json` updated with `fail_mode` definition in `$defs/environment`.
- `coreEvaluate()` internal function; public `evaluate()` wraps with fail_mode try/catch.

**Streaming window + passthrough + mid-stream abort — Section 25**
- `packages/runtime/src/streaming/stream-evaluator.ts` — new generic streaming enforcement engine.
- `evaluateWindowedStream<C>()`: rolling-window evaluation; abort mid-stream on violation with configurable `onStreamViolation`.
- `evaluatePassthroughStream<C>()`: immediate chunk yield, full-content evaluation at stream end; synthetic abort chunk on block.
- `StreamChunkAdapter<C>` interface: provider-agnostic adapter for chunk extraction and synthetic chunk construction.
- `resolveStreamConfig()`: derives effective streaming config from policy defaults + per-call `EvaluateOptions` overrides.
- OpenAI wrapper updated: dispatches to buffer / window / passthrough modes based on `evalOptions.streamMode`.
- Anthropic wrapper updated: same three-mode dispatch with Anthropic SSE event adapter.
- `EvaluateOptions` gains `streamMode`, `windowTokens`, `onStreamViolation` fields.
- `StreamMode` and `OnStreamViolation` types added to `types.ts` and exported from package root.

**Provider Adapter Interface — Section 32**
- `packages/runtime/src/adapters/adapter.ts` — `ProviderAdapter` interface with `normalizeRequest`, `denormalizeRequest`, `normalizeResponse`, `denormalizeResponse` plus `auth`, `region`, `capabilities`, `isOpenAICompat`.
- Built-in adapters for 11 providers: `openai`, `anthropic`, `groq`, `vertex`, `mistral`, `vllm`, `bedrock`, `deepseek`, `moonshot`, `zhipu`, `baichuan`.
- `packages/runtime/src/adapters/loader.ts`: `resolveAdapter()`, `registerAdapter()`, `listAdapters()`, `hasAdapter()`.
- All adapters exported from `@transparentguard/runtime` package root.
- Chinese-jurisdiction providers (`deepseek`, `moonshot`, `zhipu`, `baichuan`) carry `jurisdiction: "CN"` — blocked by `data_sovereignty` policies with `blocked_processor_jurisdictions: [CN]`.
- vLLM adapter uses `jurisdiction: "self-hosted"` sentinel to bypass jurisdiction checks for operator-controlled deployments.

**Self-hosted security posture (Helm) — Phase 10**
- `charts/transparentguard-proxy/templates/networkpolicy.yaml` — Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` for the proxy.
  - Egress: DNS (TCP/UDP 53) + HTTPS (TCP 443) only; all other egress denied.
  - Ingress: configurable; defaults to same-namespace pods on port 8080.
  - Optional Prometheus scrape allowance from `monitoring` namespace.
  - Feature-flagged via `networkPolicy.enabled` (default: `false`).
- `values.yaml` hardened security contexts:
  - `podSecurityContext`: `runAsNonRoot`, `runAsUser/Group: 1000`, `fsGroup: 1000`, `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`.
  - `securityContext`: `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`, `runAsNonRoot`, `capabilities.drop: [ALL]`, `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`.
  - Satisfies Kubernetes "restricted" Pod Security Standard.
- `values.yaml` gains `networkPolicy` block with `enabled`, `ingress`, `allowMetricsScrape`, `extraEgressPorts`, `egress`.

**Multi-cloud Terraform — Phase 10**
- `deploy/terraform/modules/gcp/` — Cloud Run (serverless, auto-scaling), VPC + NAT + Serverless VPC Access connector, Cloud SQL PostgreSQL 15, GCS audit archive with lifecycle tiering (Standard → Nearline → Coldline → Delete), Artifact Registry, Secret Manager, IAM service account with minimal permissions.
- `deploy/terraform/modules/azure/` — Azure Container Apps, VNet + subnets + NSG, Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server (HA in production), Azure Blob Storage with lifecycle management, Azure Container Registry (optional), Key Vault (RBAC mode), Managed Identity (zero-credential auth), Log Analytics workspace.
- AWS module from Phase 7 unchanged.

---

## [Unreleased] — Phase 9: Provider Scoping and Data Sovereignty

### Added

**Rule-level provider scoping — Tier 1 (Section 30)**
- `providers` field on rule objects: a glob list of `provider/model` patterns that scope a rule to specific providers.
- When set, the rule is **skipped** (not blocked) for providers that don't match — distinct from `enforce_type: provider_allowlist` which blocks the call.
- Supports wildcards (`openai/*`), negations (`!deepseek/*`), and `any`.
- Negations evaluated first: `["!deepseek/*", "any"]` blocks deepseek, allows all others.
- Missing provider field on payload → rule evaluates (fail-open for unscoped rules).

**Rule-level provider scoping — Tiers 2 & 3 (Section 30)**
- `provider_match` field on rule objects: capability, risk-tier, training-cutoff, training-jurisdiction, and attestation matching.
- `capabilities`: rule skipped if provider lacks any required capability.
- `risk_tier`: rule skipped if provider's risk tier is not in the accepted list.
- `min_context_window`: rule skipped if provider context window is below threshold.
- `training_cutoff_after`: rule skipped if provider training cutoff precedes this date.
- `blocked_training_jurisdictions` (on `provider_match`): rule skipped if provider trained in any listed country.
- `requires_attestation`: rule skipped if provider lacks any required compliance attestation.
- `requires_signed_response`: rule skipped unless provider returns TG-compatible signed response.
- `excludes`: explicit glob exclusion list evaluated before positive criteria.
- Unknown providers (not in registry) with attestation requirements → rule skipped (fail-open).

**TG Provider Registry (Section 30.7)**
- `packages/runtime/src/registry/provider-registry.ts` — embedded open registry of AI providers.
- Initial entries: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Mistral AI, Cohere, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, DeepSeek, Ollama, Hugging Face, Replicate.
- Per-provider fields: `headquarters_jurisdiction`, `training_jurisdictions`, `processing_regions`, `capabilities`, `risk_tier`, `max_context_window`, `training_cutoff`, `attestations`, `supports_signed_responses`.
- Model-level overrides that merge with provider defaults.
- `registry/REGISTRY.md` — open registry documentation, capability identifiers, attestation identifiers, risk tier definitions, submission process.
- `PROVIDER_REGISTRY.getProvider("openai/gpt-4o")` returns merged provider+model entry.
- All provider scoping exports available from `@transparentguard/runtime` barrel.

**`enforce_type: data_sovereignty` (Section 31)**
- New enforce type that extends `data_residency` with a full three-jurisdiction model.
- `data_subject_jurisdiction` — configures who this rule applies to and how jurisdiction is inferred (`geo_ip`, `request_header`, `metadata`). `accept` list with `EU`/`EEA` shorthand expansion. Rule is skipped (not violated) when subject is outside the accept list.
- `allowed_processor_regions` — cloud regions where AI processing is permitted. Prefix wildcards supported (`eu-*`).
- `blocked_processor_jurisdictions` — ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes. Takes precedence over `allowed_processor_regions`. Evaluated against the embedded region→jurisdiction mapping table covering all AWS, GCP, and Azure regions.
- `blocked_training_jurisdictions` (on rule) — blocks calls to providers whose models were trained in listed countries. Resolved from TG Provider Registry.
- `transfer_mechanism.require_one_of` — verifies a lawful GDPR transfer mechanism is in place. Values: `adequacy_decision`, `standard_contractual_clauses`, `binding_corporate_rules`, `derogation`. Adequacy decisions resolved from embedded table; SCCs/BCRs asserted via `metadata.tg_transfer_mechanism`.
- `legal_basis` — machine-readable legal basis code emitted in every sovereignty audit event (does not affect enforcement).
- Full sovereignty audit trail: `subject_jurisdiction`, `processor_jurisdiction`, `processor_region`, `transfer_mechanism_used`, `legal_basis` emitted as tags on every audit event from a sovereignty rule.

**TG Adequacy Decision Table (Section 31.5)**
- `packages/runtime/src/registry/adequacy-decisions.ts` — embedded EU Commission adequacy decision table.
- Full adequacy: Andorra, Argentina, Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Switzerland, UK, Uruguay.
- Conditional adequacy: Canada (PIPEDA sector), United States (DPF-certified organizations).
- Not-adequate entries for CN, RU, BY, IR, IN, BR (non-exhaustive).
- `isAdequate()`, `getAdequacyStatus()`, `isInEEA()`, `EU_EEA_JURISDICTIONS` exported from runtime barrel.

**New example**
- `examples/data-sovereignty.yaml` — full working example covering EU GDPR sovereignty, US HIPAA sovereignty, capability-scoped PII redaction, and high-risk provider blocking.

**Schema updates (tps-v1.json)**
- `providers` and `provider_match` fields added to rule object.
- `data_sovereignty` added to `enforce_type` enum.
- `data_subject_jurisdiction`, `allowed_processor_regions`, `blocked_processor_jurisdictions`, `blocked_training_jurisdictions`, `transfer_mechanism`, `legal_basis` fields added to rule object.
- New `$defs/provider_match`, `$defs/data_subject_jurisdiction`, `$defs/transfer_mechanism` definitions.
- New `allOf` conditional: `data_sovereignty` enforce type requires at least one of `allowed_processor_regions`, `blocked_processor_jurisdictions`, or `blocked_training_jurisdictions`.
- `allowed_regions` description updated to note `data_sovereignty` with `allowed_processor_regions` is preferred for new deployments.

**Runtime exports**
- `ProviderCapabilityMatch`, `DataSubjectJurisdiction`, `TransferMechanismConfig` types exported from `@transparentguard/runtime`.
- `providerMatchesRuleScope`, `matchesProviderGlob` exported.
- `enforceDataSovereignty` exported.
- `PROVIDER_REGISTRY`, `ProviderRegistryEntry` exported.
- `ADEQUACY_DECISIONS`, `AdequacyEntry`, `TransferMechanism`, `getAdequacyStatus`, `isAdequate`, `isInEEA`, `EU_EEA_JURISDICTIONS` exported.

### Changed

- `EnforceType` union in `packages/runtime/src/types.ts` extended with `"data_sovereignty"`.
- `TPSRule` interface extended with all new provider scoping and sovereignty fields.
- Engine `evaluateRule()` now checks `providerMatchesRuleScope()` before dispatching to any rule evaluator.
- `enforce_type: provider_allowlist` description updated to clarify the distinction from rule-level `providers` scoping.

---

## [Unreleased] — Runtime v0.3.1 enforcement tightening

### Changed

**Free tier now requires an API key**
- All free tier users must obtain a `tg_sk_live_` API key via signup at transparentguard.dev.
- The key is free, permanent, and requires no credit card.
- Set `TG_API_KEY` in your environment before initializing the runtime.
- Previously, the free tier ran without any API key. This is no longer supported.
- Air-gapped and enterprise deployments are unaffected and continue to use `TG_LICENSE_KEY`.

### Changed (continued)

**License enforcement — fail-closed on API unreachability**
- The runtime no longer silently downgrades to the free tier when the TransparentGuard license API is unreachable.
- New behavior: if a valid license status was cached within the last hour (grace window), that status is used and a warning is logged. If no grace cache is available, the runtime throws `TransparentGuardError` with code `api_unreachable` rather than continuing as free.
- This prevents the bypass vector where network-isolating the license server allowed indefinite free-tier operation.

**Audit chain integrity — gated on `audit_chain_integrity` feature**
- `audit.chain_integrity.enabled: true` in a TPS policy now requires the `audit_chain_integrity` license feature (Startup tier and above).
- Free-tier callers with `chain_integrity` configured will see a warning logged and chain integrity will be silently disabled (fields `prev_event_hash` and `chain_sequence` will not be set on audit events).
- Previously, chain integrity ran for any caller who configured it.

**Threshold breach notifications — gated on `threshold_notifications` feature**
- `action: notify` (outbound webhook) and `action: block_all` (system-wide suspension) in `thresholds` now require the `threshold_notifications` license feature (Startup tier and above).
- Free-tier callers will see a per-trigger warning logged; the violation is still counted and the `threshold_triggered` audit event is still emitted, but the outbound action is suppressed.
- `action: escalate` is unaffected — it only sets evaluation tags and produces no outbound I/O or system state changes, so it remains available on all tiers.
- Previously, all threshold actions ran regardless of license tier.

**Compliance framework templates — gated on `compliance_frameworks` feature**
- `compliance_frameworks` in a TPS policy now requires the `compliance_frameworks` license feature (Startup tier and above).
- Free-tier callers that declare `compliance_frameworks` will receive `TransparentGuardError` with code `feature_requires_paid_tier`.
- Previously, all framework rule sets (HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2, EU AI Act, FedRAMP) ran regardless of license tier.

**Custom classifier registry — gated on `oem_embed` feature**
- Resolving a classifier via `custom_classifiers` in a TPS policy or via `registerClassifier()` now requires the `oem_embed` license feature (OEM tier).
- Previously, custom classifiers ran for any caller who configured them.

**PIE shadow mode — gated on `pie` feature**
- `pie.shadow_mode` in a TPS policy is silently disabled unless the `pie` license feature is present (Growth tier and above).
- Non-throwing: shadow mode simply does not run rather than erroring, since it is a background observability feature.

**Evaluation receipts — gated on `trust_chain` feature**
- Signed ECDSA-P256 evaluation receipts are only generated when the `trust_chain` license feature is present (Enterprise tier and above).
- Previously, receipts were generated unconditionally for all callers.

### Added

**New `LicenseFeature` values**
- `"trust_chain"` — controls receipt generation and key rotation watcher access.
- `"pie"` — controls PIE shadow mode and drift detection.
- `"audit_chain_integrity"` — controls SHA-256/SHA3-256 Merkle chain on audit logs.
- `"threshold_notifications"` — controls `action: notify` webhook delivery and `action: block_all` system suspension.

**Threshold `action: escalate` remains free** — it only tags the evaluation context; no outbound I/O or system state change occurs.
